#HCSR04 Example

This code was built with Visual Micro, run the Prebuild.bat to copy required files from root first.

This example will simply connect to the sensor and output the distance to the serial port.

Note: The copied files should not be edited, only edit the root files if you need to and  rerun the batch file.
